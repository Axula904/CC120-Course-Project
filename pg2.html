      <h1>May 1, 2006</h1>
      <h4 class="w3-padding-32 indent">The proposed <abbr title="Border Protection, Antiterrorism, and Illegal immigration control act">H.R.4437</abbr> act of 2005 would surly lead to harsher treatment towards immigrants in the United States, through harsher monitoring and enforcement of the US-Mexico border specifically. In response to this proposed act, throughout much of 2006 immigration reform protests took place. The most notable of these protests was the Great American Boycott, also known as the Day Without An Immigrant, which took place on May 1, 2006. </h4>

      <h5>The Great American Boycott was a nationwide protest in an effort to demonstrate the importance and necessity of the immigrant population in the United States. While the goal of the protest was to shut down the country did not come to fruition, the protest had an unavoidable presence with over 1 million people across the nation.</h5>

      <h1>Febuary 16, 2017</h1>
      <h4 class="w3-padding-32 indent">During the presidency of Donald Trump, one thing that was quite explicit was his views on immigration in the United States and what should be done to enforce immigration and work to deport those who were living in the United States already, or those who had been detained. A common reaction to the Trump campaign was one generally filled with a preparedness to resist against whatever may come.</h4>

      <h5>One of these demonstrations of resistance took place on February 16, 2017. Widely regarded as the Day Without Immigrants, this protest in many ways echoed the same message and ambition of the Day Without An Immigrant protest in 2006, hoping to represent the necessity and positivity of immigration in the United States.</h5>

    <h1>Similarities</h1>
    <h4 class="indent">Both of these protests existed to show the importance and necessity of immigration for the United States, as many of the nations essential workers may be undocumented peoples. These proteses share many similarities with the work done by Dolores Huerta and Cesar Chavez to nonviolently fight for improvement of worker conditions. Many of these workers are immigrants who still get their lives abused and seen as expendable.</h4>
